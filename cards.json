Each tick, it extends a tendril one square per MAG toward each target at priority  MAG * 4. If it enters the same square as a creature, it will immediately wrap around the creature, using one LEN per MAG per tick until its target is encased, and dealing 1d4 damage per LEN spent --  unlike its cousin, Ecstacy is not gentle. It wraps and crushes and burrows into whatever it catches. Once a creature is fully encased (if it's alive), it heals 1 point for each wound encased for every tick so encased. This process uses up 4 joy per point healed (reducing LEN by the same number).
